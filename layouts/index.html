                  <p>I’m a third year CSE PhD student at UCSD advised by <a href="https://patpannuto.com/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1">Pat Pannuto</a>. I'm interested in deployable, sensing systems in real-world environments.
                    I am always interested in finding interesting ways to collect information about (i.e. sense) the environment while acknowledging the limitations to actually put something out in the real world (i.e. limited power).
                    I currently lead two projects:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Lights, Camera, Grid!</b></li>
                    Our vision is to enable autonomous monitoring of the electic grid by imaging visible lights (e.g. street lights, house lights) with cameras. This project intersects knowledge regarding signal processing, machine learning, and computer vision.
                    <!-- As our infrastructures constantly change and progress, so does the electric grid. As of now, there are little efforts to efficiently and effectively monitor our low voltage electricity (i.e. the electricity supplied to our homes). Ubiquitous smart meters would be great, but that's a timely and costly effort amidst our evolving infrastructures. As a result, we'd like to automate this monitoring capability while addressing the deployability issue. Light bulbs powered by the electric grid  Our project aim to automate grid monitoring with cameras and visible light and This project intersects the  -->
                    <li><b>LoRa Analysis (via Helium)</b></li>
                    <a href="https://www.helium.com/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1">Helium</a> (recently rebranded to Nova Labs) is the reason that there are about <i>one million</i> LoRa gateways spread across the world.
                    This provides an opportunity to analyze LoRa in ways that would usually require a single person (or group of people) to set up many gateways themselves.
