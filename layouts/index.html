                  <p>I’m a third year CSE PhD student at UCSD advised by <a href="https://patpannuto.com/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1">Pat Pannuto</a>. I'm interested in deployable, sensing systems in real-world environments.
                    I am also always interested in exploring creative and different ways to sense our environment to solve societal or large scale problems, while acknowledging the limitations (e.g. power) to actually put something out in the real world.
                    I currently lead two projects:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Lights, Camera, Grid!</b></li>
                    Electricity powers our everyday appliances but can oftentimes be unreliable, particularly in rural areas and developing countries. However, we can attempt to capture nuances in our electricity quality with the fact that light bulbs can exhibit this quality through visible lights, such as street lights, house lights. Our vision is to enable autonomous monitoring of the electic grid by imaging these visible lights with commodity cameras to document the low-voltage grid infrastructure to enable efficient monitoring and response to issues that arise, as well as electricity quality monitoring (e.g. voltage).
                    <!-- As our infrastructures constantly change and progress, so does the electric grid. As of now, there are little efforts to efficiently and effectively monitor our low voltage electricity (i.e. the electricity supplied to our homes). Ubiquitous smart meters would be great, but that's a timely and costly effort amidst our evolving infrastructures. As a result, we'd like to automate this monitoring capability while addressing the deployability issue. Light bulbs powered by the electric grid  Our project aim to automate grid monitoring with cameras and visible light and This project intersects the  -->
                    <li><b>LoRa Analysis (via Helium)</b></li>
                    <a href="https://www.helium.com/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1">Helium</a> (recently rebranded to Nova Labs) is the reason that there are about <i>one million</i> LoRa gateways spread across the world.
                    This provides an opportunity to analyze LoRa in ways that would usually require a single person (or group of people) to set up many gateways themselves.
