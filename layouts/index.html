                  <p>I’m a fourth year CSE PhD student at UCSD advised by <a href="https://patpannuto.com/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1">Pat Pannuto</a>, and I also work pretty closely with <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~schulman/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1">Aaron Schulman</a>. My specialty lies in measurement and analysis with a particular interest in deployable, wide-area sensing systems as well as infrastructure.
                    My current research focus lies in Internet of Things (IoT) wireless coverage to understand the flaws and successes in existing infrastructures to induce productive change for future infrastructures.
                    Generally, I am interested in a broad range of sensing and wireless applications.
                    I currently work on the following projects:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>"Lights, Camera, [Grid]!"</b></li>
                    Electricity powers our everyday appliances but can oftentimes be unreliable, particularly in rural areas and developing countries. However, we can attempt to capture nuances in our electricity quality with the knowledge that our electricity powers visible lights too—namely street lights and house lights—such that we can quantize and analyze the light emitted by visible lights. Our vision is to enable autonomous monitoring of the electic grid by imaging these visible lights with commodity cameras, eventually allowing centralized entities to monitor electricity and respond to grid faults more efficiently and effectively.
                    <!-- As our infrastructures constantly change and progress, so does the electric grid. As of now, there are little efforts to efficiently and effectively monitor our low voltage electricity (i.e. the electricity supplied to our homes). Ubiquitous smart meters would be great, but that's a timely and costly effort amidst our evolving infrastructures. As a result, we'd like to automate this monitoring capability while addressing the deployability issue. Light bulbs powered by the electric grid  Our project aim to automate grid monitoring with cameras and visible light and This project intersects the  -->
                    <li><b>LoRa Analysis (via Helium)</b></li>
                    <a href="https://blog.apnic.net/2022/02/09/measuring-a-decentralized-network/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1">Helium</a> (recently rebranded to Nova Labs) is the reason that there are about <i>one million</i> LoRa gateways spread across the world.
                    This provides an opportunity to analyze LoRa in ways that would usually require a single person (or group of people) to set up many gateways themselves.
                  </ul>
