**WARNING: Suicidal thoughts/OCD, so read with caution. I was never actually suicial, but I'll explain my situation afterwards. Also, excuse me for only using he/him/his pronouns in advance; this was written a while back**

(Man, writing these entries are not getting easier for me, and I know this is somewhat redundant of me saying this, but I am so goddam lazy about writing in this diary…)

But anyway, I’ve come to a realization of something about myself – I’m dangerous. Not towards myself only, but towards other people. I keep having these thoughts of, “what if…” and it scares me about the thoughts that pop up in my mind. “What if I make a sudden jerk in the wheel, and drive straight into a tree? What if I talk really badly about someone to his own face, even though he’s really nice? What if I just punch someone in the face just for the heck of it?”

I’ve always had these scenarios pop up in my head for as long as I can remember, and it scares me sometimes, because I feel like one of these days I’ll actually commit to one of these “what if” situations, which is really bad. I’ll end up jumping off a bridge by a random impulse without actually thinking about the dangerous situation, and my life will all be over in an instant.

And that’s also the other thing that I’m worried about – the thought that I can end “it” right here, right now. I’ve had these random thoughts in my head sometimes of killing myself. DON’T GET ME WRONG, it’s not like I actually intend to kill myself. But, it goes along the line of my sudden thoughts of a “what if” situation, and my impulse actually running loose. I feel like if I were to die, I probably won’t die a peaceful, long life. Rather, I’d find some way to accidentally (or purposefully) kill myself. “I’ll be dead before I know it,” is a thought that has always lingered in my mind, and I believe in some sense, that’s true. Obviously I’ll be able to accomplish things in my life, and I’ll be able to live my life well, but when I’m about to die, I feel like I’ll be thinking, “yeah, my life is over before I knew it.”

Anyway, this was just something I wanted to get off my mind.
