There’s something else that I realized from this break – *time* is VERY important to me. I think that the reason why I was jealous when people were hanging out and I wasn’t was because I wasn’t making the most of my time. Almost the majority of my time, I feel like I’m wasting it, and that just irks on my heart because I feel like I should be doing more with it. I realized now that if I had all the time in the world, I wouldn’t give a damn about what I do with it. I’d waste as much of it as I could, because I know that I can eventually catch up with the actual stuff I want to accomplish.

Mm, I think I got all I wanted to say down, but I think I’m at a lost for words right now.
