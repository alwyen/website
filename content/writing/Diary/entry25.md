Well, I have finals and some projects/essay coming up in the next couple days, but my yearning to become a part of the MIT community has become rather unbearable. I wish I was done with finals so that I could let these emotions that I’m holding inside explode out of me, but I feel like that has to wait. So, I’m writing in my diary now to release a little bit of that explosion in the form of a “mini explosion.”

Why has my desire to be a part of MIT become unbearable? Well, it’s just that I feel that I could be doing so much more. To be honest, I’m not even sure if my academic levels are strong enough to get into MIT, but it’s the fact that I just want to do so much more with my life that I just can’t stand life here at UMass. Don’t get me wrong, UMass isn’t a walk in the park. I’m not saying that I want to leave UMass because it’s too easy, because it definitely is not. I want to leave UMass because I’m somewhat fed up with myself. I feel like I’m not using myself to my own potential. I could be learning so much more, doing so much more, yet I spend most of my time in my dorm room, either moping around, studying, or playing games with my roommates – I feel like I just can’t stand this life anymore, and I want to live a new life. I want to be able to explore – to meet new people, to discover new things, to *learn more*. To discover more of my passions, to embrace my creativity, and to be who *I* truly am. I feel that UMass is just a place that cannot provide me with such aspects that I wish I could have in my life right now. Every time I think of MIT, I think to myself, what would I be doing right now? Would I be socializing with people? Would I be working on a project, beating my mind and body out to prepare for a competition? Or, would I simply be cramming for an exam the next day, all stressed out?

Before, when I first started writing in my diary, I said I would at least be content with staying here at UMass. But now, my feelings for MIT have just become unbearable. I want to do more with my life, and I feel that MIT just may provide me with that desire.
