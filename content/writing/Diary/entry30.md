Well, back at it again. I feel like I’m losing steam again. Not emotionally and about my life, but about this school. For these past couple weeks, I’ve been trying to get involved more with the UMass community and other friends, and I’ve had some of my best times here within the past week (going into town with Anon1, *Anon*, *Anon*, and Anon2 was really fun – we also found *Anon* and *Anon* at LimeRed Tea House that night; also, the SouthWest “riot” was really entertaining as well) (*Note*: after every Super Bowl (usually when the Patriots are in it?), there's usually a celebration (or straight up riot, depending on a win or loss) after the game; they can get pretty festive/hectic...). But, I have to let out some of my thoughts once again.

I don’t know why, but I truly think it’s the community that brings me down so. I’ve been doing as much as I could to stay out of the dorm room, and for a while it somewhat paid off. Well, ok, maybe it’s not the community, but rather Anon3 and Anon4. I don’t discuss any of the issues I have with them, and I just let it slide. They do respect some of my requests occasionally, but since they’re the ones that usually agree with each other, I’m the one that’s somewhat ruled out. I guess that’s kind of my reason to decide to room with Anon2 as opposed to Anon3 and Anon4 next year; they also play games wayy too much, and it somewhat bugs me. But, then that means that we probably won’t see each other anymore on campus, unless we deliberately meet up – this is one thing I’m worried about.

I really wish there was someone I could talk to about this right now – someone that I’m close with (and the only viable person that I can think of is Anon5 – lol I always think of Anon6 first, but that option was never there). I wish I could talk about my roommate situation, or even my despair from living here at UMass.

All in all, I don’t think it’s just Anon3 and Anon4, but rather UMass. I know I just need to get good grades and then go to a really good graduate school, but I feel like I’m starting to suffer here again at UMass. I’m not even thinking about MIT this time, and I still feel like UMass is somewhat weighing me down. (Wait, now that I think of it, Anon1 and Anon2 are people who I can talk to about my situation here at UMass – this was random, but w/e. Just thinking about Anon1 and Anon2 somewhat made me feel more welcome here…)

This choice isn’t definitive yet, but from writing this, I think I may want to transfer out of this school in the following spring semester. If I end up transferring out, I really hope my grades don’t suffer, and I hope that I won’t have to make up that much work for my major in another school. Right now, I need to get out of this fking dorm room… it’s starting to make me feel depressed.
