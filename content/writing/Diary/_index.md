I somehow decided to share my *entire* (70k+ word) diary with a couple friends of mine – don't really remember what got me into doing that, but here we are haha (and I don't regret it!). Sharing my diary made me realize that sharing parts of my life with others meant something to me; connecting with other people made me *feel*. So I decided to share parts of my diary here – unfortunately, I won't be able to share all of it, but I think (or hope) some of the entries I put up will be interesting and enjoyable.

(For the sake of anonymizing people in my diary, I'll be replacing their names w.r.t. each entry – pseudonyms won't persist between entries.)
