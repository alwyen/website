I somehow decided to share my *entire* (70k+ word) diary with a couple friends of mine – don't really remember what got me into doing that, but here we are haha (and I don't regret it!). Sharing my diary made me realize that sharing parts of my life with others meant something to me.

So here are parts of my diary – unfortunately, I won't be able to share all of it, but I think (or hope) some of the entries I put up will be interesting and enjoyable.

(For the sake of anonymizing people in my diary, I'll be replacing names w.r.t. each entry – pseudonyms won't persist between entries. Also, please understand that people change – my diary goes back 4+ years, and what I wrote about might be of the distant past; I don't mean to personally attack anyone, and I'm merely sharing things from my perspective/personal life.)
