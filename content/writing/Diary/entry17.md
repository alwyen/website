I feel like the need to write in this diary has decreased drastically… or more so, the desire to write. I’ve gotten pretty lazy with this, and I feel like nothing major has happened these past few days. But, I recently thought of something “painful” that I did to someone, and I still regret it till this day.

Do you remember Anon1? Well, yeah, I definitely wasn’t a big fan of him/her. In high school,he/she seemed ok. Kept low profile, only “exploded” a couple times, and tried to be nice towards other people. Junior high was VERY different though. During eighth grade, you could even say that he/she went to the extent of bullying me. I feel like he/she probably was part of the factor of who I am today; me being very paranoid, that is. He/She always made fun of me for being in AE (*Note*: Accelerated/Enriched, versus Honors, the harder version) math. He/She would talk low to me, and I felt like there was nothing I could do to fight back. Till this day, I still have trouble talking back when I feel like I’m overall insignificant, and I’m still trying to develop methods or become better at making “comebacks.” But anyway, he/she definitely bullied me a lot, and sometimes he/she would even kick or hit me. I never said anything to him/her, and I never told any teachers in school. But I remember one time in eighth grade that I absolutely regret.

Anon1 and I were in the same art class, and when I thought he/she stole my chair, I immediately pulled it from under his/her ass. Literally. I don’t know what got into me, but I felt like confronting him/her, standing up to him/her and giving him/her the shit that he/she gave me for the past year. He/She fell on the floor, and I walked back to my table, sitting down on his/her stool. I’m pretty sure people definitely noticed, and I feel like that somewhat gave me a bad profile.

As you probably guessed, he/she definitely didn’t like that. He/She said that he/she wasn’t the one that took my chair, and he/she hit me on the head for that (I think). I felt really bad afterwards, so after he/she hit me, I immediately apologized, and I think we somewhat left each other at that. He/She stopped harping on me, and I didn’t say anything back to him/her. I guess that’s just a part of my “weak” side that I still need to fix – being too apologetic. But, the reason why I’m writing about this is because I want to discuss this: am I the one to blame, or him/her?

Right off the bat, I don’t want to blame him/her, but I can’t say that I can’t blame him/her. He/She gave me a lot of stress that year, and he/she was one of the people in my grade I disliked the most. I didn’t want to talk to him/her at all, and he/she made me feel uncomfortable in class, similar to how Anon2 made me feel really uncomfortable in Stats class; god, I still really don’t like that kid.

But should I have pulled his/her chair? Just because he/she treated me bad, was my action justifiable? I definitely wouldn’t think so, but I’d say I can forgive myself for it. Pulling Anon1’s chair was something I really regret, but I think it’s something I should just move on from and leave at the back of my mind. Well, I guess this is another embarrassing moment I can leave behind.
