I began a digital diary my freshman year of college. It was one of those things I started somewhat therapeutically – I often think too much and get into my own head, so writing acted as an outlet to all my drowning thoughts. But since then, writing became a way to express myself; it’s allowed myself to keep track of all my significant moments in life. The (recent) happy and sad, philosophical, nonsensical, heartfelt, and mentally hard/most depressing parts of my life – it’s all extant.

As of now, most of my writing has been through my diary, but I'm hoping to expand that into other things, like parts about myself, random  things that happen in life, and thoughts that I want to share with others. This part of my website is pretty empty for now, but hopefully it'll fill up throughout grad school.

I hope you enjoy
