I got really lucky â€“ I left a block of tofu for my roommates in the fridge before I left for home back in November, and I discovered it still in the fridge when I came back to school yesterday. LUCKILY (I don't know how), the tofu got frozen solid (*in the fridge*), and I fricken triple bagged that shit and threw it out immediately. Can you imagine what a month and a half old block of tofu would have smelled like if that thing didn't freeze solid...? oh god
