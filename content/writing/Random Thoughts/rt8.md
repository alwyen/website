I usually don't rant about this shit online, but legit so many fricken things have gone wrong today and I still got shit to do and I just fricken can't anymore

I forgot my laptop charger back at the office went I went back to drive a friend somewhere at 3pm today, so I was already annoyed by that, and later I had to drop him off and pick him up at a location; while I was waiting for him I decided to continue reading/annotating a paper I had to read for class tomorrow but somehow fricken dropped my highlighter at an impossible-to-reach place in my car and got super pissed off at that; then I decided to go back to the office (here I am) to get some work done because I'm usually super unproductive in my room at night but I realized that I didn't have a fricken highlighter to actually annotate my stuff, but luckily I realized that I had this shitty highlighter on me so I figured I'd just use that, but then I realized I actually left the fucking paper at home in my other notebook because I thought I didn't need it and so coming to the lab was basically pointless now cause I coulda just come to the office tomorrow morning because I can last the night without my charger and now I have to go back home because I left my shit at home and yeah, I'm just super super done

IMC paper submission is also on Wednesday and I also found out an hour ago that these past 8 weeks that I spent on a particular part of my research was basically wrong and pointless so I'm just not having it tonight and now I'm just in total disbelief that all this shit actually happened today which usually never happens
