I'm usually not one for taking naps, but I was feeling a bit exhausted and hit the bed for a bit; woke up feeling suuuper cranky – was definitely not havin it...

Thought I just needed to have some dinner in the end but decided to have a *huge* *** bowl of icecream instead – what do you know, works like magic (highly recommend this remedy)

(the flavor was branded as "Denali Extreme Moose Tracks" btw – *super* sweet)

(I'm also not one to usually get icecream (not really a sweet-tooth type person), but my parents always have some tubs of icecream at home, and my roommate (having some in our freezer) just reminded me of that...)
