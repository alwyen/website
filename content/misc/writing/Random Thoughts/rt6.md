I almost spelled "drawer" "droor" this morning... I guess it's just one of those mornings...

also, in response to @RT5, I wasn't crazy â€“ I double checked the price the following week and it really was lower.. bought it that day and cooked it that day and it still smelled gross.. so now my favorite vegetable has been tainted and i won't be getting it for a while now sad
