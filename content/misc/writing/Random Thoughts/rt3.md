Tonight was probably one of *the* worst nights yet – one of my project deadlines was pushed *up* one day, and that in addition to my fellowship application had to be done by tonight (11:59pm PST). Like dude, wtf, I legit just needed ONE more day to work on 237C. Honestly, my partner is a life savior – legit like carried me in the last week and wrote like the whole fricken report by himself. My brain was so fricken dead when I was trying to write shit – I was legit writing gibberish, and it took me like 5 minutes to come up with ONE sentence. God dangit dude… I think my fellowship submission went okay, but man 237C was rough – bless my partner’s soul man I’m so tired rn
