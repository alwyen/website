Writing these types of essays can feel really daunting -- I think anyone who's written them can say that. But with enough preparation, I honestly feel like any application can be pretty competitive. I would say that just getting ideas down on paper early is pretty important. Sure, your first draft might not be good, but polished essays don't manifest overnight. They take many, many weeks of formulating various pieces of information into strong, convincing statements.

I'll refrain from saying more as this page isn't really to give advice (plus this page will get pretty cluttered). Please do not hesistate to reach out if you'd like to hear more from me about this! I'm always willing to help out others :)

<!-- * Start *early*; I think I had my first draft done sometime in late August/early September, but I think I honestly wished I had an initial draft even earlier (sometime around late July/early August). You need enough time, revisions, and discussions to gather and filter all your ideas to put together concise, compelling essays! -->
<!-- * Have people read and edit your essays (this should be a given). I had multiple friends and my advisor read my essays early on and got a lot of feedback. I definitely think I was lucky that my advisor was able to read it over for a couple iterations, but that might not be the case for everyone. If your advisor can't give you that time, then definitely find someone else that can critique your essays! -->
<!-- * I think something that I keep reflecting on from my advisor's advice is that these essays are really non-traditional -- make it as easy as possible for reviewers to digest your information (however that may be). For instance, something that felt so strange to me initially was how I talked about my broader impacts before my intellectual merrit on multiple occaisions. This was recommended by my advisor, and in . Restructure your essays however you feel so that you can get your message across succinctly! -->
<!-- * Lastly, don't go in expecting a win -- I accidentally did that initially and had to stop myself because I knew that mentality would ruin my essays. It's good to feel confident, but take a step back and critically analyze your essay as if reading from an outside perspective. -->
