I began a digital diary my freshman year of college. It was one of those things I started somewhat therapeutically â€“ I often think too much and get into my own head, so writing acted as an outlet to all my drowning thoughts. As of now, most of my writing has been through my diary, but I'm hoping to share other pieces of writing through other things (short stories, random things and whatnot). This part of my website is pretty empty for now, but it'll hopefully fill up throughout grad school
