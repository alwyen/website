I began a digital diary my freshman year of college. It was one of those things I started somewhat therapeutically â€“ I often think too much and get into my own head, so writing acted as an outlet to all my drowning thoughts. As of now, most of my writing has been through my diary, but I'm hoping to share other pieces of writing through other things. This part of my website had some stuff but I removed it cause it was a little to much for me, but I want to eventually put up some more refined pieces in the future!
